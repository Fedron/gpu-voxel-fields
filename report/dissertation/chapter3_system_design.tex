Hello.

\section{Testing Approach}

\begin{itemize}
    \item GPU timestamps, before + after computer shader dispatch
    \item Distance field execution time measured in milliseconds
    \item Static world as the benchmark (updates disabled)
    \item Dynamic world using a simple falling sand simulation, sand generator top left, water generator top right
    \item Dynamic update test run on multiple world sizes, from 8x8x8, to 512x512x512
    \item Update speed limited to 10 world updates per second.
    \item Measure average execution time, standard deviation
    \item Additional measure of FPS and delta time, compare to static world to determine playability
    \item Vulkan application compiled in release mode + no debug or validation layers
\end{itemize}
